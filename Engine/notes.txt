This is where the Engine to Rule them All shall live.

The Engine will manage the JSON structure and serialization, updating it or serving it, depending on what it's asked to do. 
Will be implemented in Perl, running as a server with a predefined command set for available modes of operation.

Update, 2013-06-23:
I'm thinking about trying to implement the Engine in C++ instead, as it will probably mostly handle storing and retrtrieving data, not much regex and text parsing. Inspired by the book "The C++ Standard Library 2. Edition" :)
